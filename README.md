# SASMultivariate
A collection of multivariate analyses using SAS. Here, I work with three example data sets: one on the effects of three different treatments on coordination (CoordinationData), another on house characteristics and local factors (HouseData), and another on student test scores (StudentData).

## Data

**CoordinationData** *(.csv)* - Spreadsheet containing data on how coordination and alertness after sleep deprivation are affected by three experimental treatments: control (A) and two different drugs (B, C). A test was used to measure coordination and alertness (on a 0-100 scale) after 12, 18, 24, and 30 hours of sleep deprivation.

**HouseData** *(.csv)* - Spreadsheet containing data on 75 different houses in a particular area. Each entry contains data for number of bedrooms (Nbr), number of bathrooms (Nba), number of stories (Stry), square footage (Sqft), price in USD, and whether or not the house is in a neighbourhood with an HOA. 5 other variables for each house are also measured on a 1-10 scale: access to recreation and amenities (Rec), local education/school quality (Edu), local crime rates (Crm), access to greenspace and parks (Grn), and access to public transit (Trn). Note that unlike the other 1-10 scale variables, a lower crime score is better.

**StudentData** *(.csv)* - Spreadsheet containing data from 40 students at a particular public high school. Each entry contains data from aptitude tests on mathematics, physics, English, and history, as well as whether or not the student is enrolled in the school's advance math programme. Grade point average (GPA) and weekly hours spend on non-sports extracurricular activities (NSECH) are also included.

## Scripts

**CoordinationData** *(.sas)* - Script used to analyse the data from the concentration/alertness experiment.

**HouseData** *(.sas)* - Script used to analyse the housing data.

**StudentData** *(.sas)* - Script used to analyse the student data.

## Outputs

**CoordinationDataOutput** *(.pdf)* - SAS output from the corresponding script. [will be uploaded soon]

**HouseDataOutput** *(.pdf)* - SAS output from the corresponding script.

**StudentDataOutput** *(.pdf)* - SAS output from the corresponding script.
